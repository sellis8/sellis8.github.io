# About Me
Hey! My name is Stephanie, and I'm using this site for my school account with Wake Tech!
This repository will hold assignments for CTI-110.

## My Interests
I absolutely **love** going on nature walks and trying out new (to me) restaurants.
I also really enjoy spending time with my family and my pets.

## Websites I Recommend
    - [LinkedIn] (www.linkedin.com) - I find LinkedIn very helpful for gaining knowledge (LinkedIn Learning) as well as networking with other individuals in the data/IT fields. 
    - [YouTube] (www.youtube.com) - When I am stuck or want to learn about something further I always turn to Youtube. With its vast range of videos, I can always find what I need.
