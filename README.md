## Websites I Recommend
    - [LinkedIn] (www.linkedin.com) - I find LinkedIn very helpful for gaining knowledge (LinkedIn Learning) as well as networking with other individuals in the data/IT fields. 
    - [YouTube] (www.youtube.com) - When I am stuck or want to learn about something further I always turn to Youtube. With its vast range of videos, I can always find what I need.
